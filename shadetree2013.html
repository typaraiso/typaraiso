<h1 class="portfolioContent">NHS: HALLOWEEN GIFTS</h1>

<h2>FALL 2013</h2>
<p>My school's NHS chapter does an annual event where we make gift bags for the local Shadetree. 
The Shadetree is a nonprofit organization that shelters abused women and their children. My officer team 
and I thought that we could give back to the community by delivering goodie bags full of candy for the children 
considering that they do not get to leave their shelter to trick or treat.


</p>

<p>This impacted me on a level I can't even begin to describe. Outside the shelter I saw a block lined with homeless 
people shivering out in the cold. The children in the shelter were my age and they had to live with scant resources. 
It gave me a new appreciation of life and I will never forget it. This qualifies for my school's teamwork/collaboration 
tenant because it required me to work in coordination with my officer team.
