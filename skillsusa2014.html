<h1 class="portfolioContent">SKILLUSA: STATE 2014</h1>

<h2> SPRING 2014</h2>
<p>	SkillsUSA is an organization that prepares high school students for the world of work. Because I was impressed with the results of the state conference the year prior, I decided to involve myself in the program further by becoming a state officer. I ran for state officer with a campaign designed by myself (pictured below)

I managed to become elected a state officer along with my colleague, Kat Chang, to represent Southwest Career Technical Academy. The duties of a state officer include attending that year’s national conference to develop leadership abilities, organizing the following year’s state conference, among other responsibilities. I am ecstatic going towards the next year!
