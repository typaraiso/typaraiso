<h1 class="portfolioContent">MODES PROJECT</h1>

<h2>WINTER 2013</h2>
<p>For AP English my instructor, Mrs. Bailin, assigned us a project where we wrote several essays and academic 
summaries (precis) based on the nine modes of literature, narration, description, exemplification, process, 
cause/effect, compare/contrast, classification/division, definition, and argument. We were also put into a team 
of two so we can analyze the mode that we were assigned. I was assigned the exemplification mode, which is essentially 
an essay where you provide a series of examples as proof for an argument. We presented this to the class along with providing 
handouts that pertained to our mode of literature.</p>

<p>	The project was time consuming, occupying most of my free time. An essay and a preci was due every week and it was an arduous 
task to complete both, along with completing other deadlines I had throughout the week. I would say that the preci writing made my 
writing stronger! It helped me with incorporating source text into my own writing and it allowed for my analysis skills to grow. 
The essays, while not the best, were a good exercise to help me get accustomed to writing essays every week. I am capable of 
writing essays with ease now. Prior to this project I had difficulty beginning a paragraph, but it comes naturally now. To see the 
work I have completed for this project here is a link:  This project qualifies for the writing skills tenant in my school because 
it shows growth in my ability to write.
