<h1 class="portfolioContent">LEAD CONFERENCE: DENVER</h1>

<h2>FALL 2013</h2>
<p>The annual Lead conference is for NHS and STUCO chapters around the nation. Students that 
are a part of these chapters congregate in one location every year to develop their leadership abilities 
and build connections with like minded people. My chapter's officer team went, and it was a requirement to attend 
because I am my NHS chapter's president elect.

</p>

<p>The conference was great and I participated in a leadership building workshop. I worked in coordination 
with other students to build my abilities to lead others. The conference was fantastic because of the guest speakers 
they chose to speak for us. I will always remember the words of encouragement given to me to always persevere no matter 
the circumstance. This qualifies for my school's teamwork/collaboration tenant because it built my skills to work in a team.
