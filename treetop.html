<h1 class="portfolioContent">TREETOP ACADEMY: 2013</h1>

<h2> SUMMER 2013</h2>
<p>	Treetop Academy is an annual summer camp offered to middle school students. 
The purpose of the academy is to cover the basic technology courses offered at Southwest Career 
Technical Academy, culminating in a finished product that they can take home and show off to their parents. 
The camp runs for four days from June 10th to June 14th.</p>

<p>This was my first time participating in Treetop Academy and I didn’t know what to expect. 
The middle school students had the choice to attend classes ranging from animation, website design, 
video editing, digital art, and more. I was in charge of the Coyote Survival Tips class, which aimed 
to give tips to incoming Freshmen about Southwest and high school in general. One of my students, David, 
was so enamored with the program that he even ended up creating and presenting his own introductory presentation 
to the students at the camp. It was great to know that I helped facilitate growth in an incoming Freshman! 
The four days were great, and it really showed me how much I grew as not only a student but also as a person. 
I didn’t know I was capable of teaching students until I was put into that position. This event qualifies for my 
school’s content knowledge tenant because I was using my knowledge of high school to instruct students. </p>
