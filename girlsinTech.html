<h1 class="portfolioContent">GIRLS IN TECH: 2011</h1>

<h2>SPRING 2013</h2>
<p>My program area hosted the Girls In Tech conference for our Spring PBL during my Junior year. 
The purpose of this conference is to target young girls and get them interested in the technology industry. 
Middle school girls from Fertita and Canarelli were invited to our school. My job for this conference is to teach 
the students how to make a game using the application, Scratch.
</p>

<p>The conference was tiring because it ran for two days. I went through with it though and it was worth it 
because I was able to instruct a group of students successfully. It felt really good to provide awareness for the 
tech industry and give back to my community. This conference qualifies for my schoolâ€™s professional presentation and 
work ethic tenant because the conference required me to present information to a group of people and I volunteered to do 
the presenting for my group.
