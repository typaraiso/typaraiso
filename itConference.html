<h1 class="portfolioContent">IT CONFERENCE: 2011</h1>

<h2>SPRING 2011</h2>
<p>	For Freshman year the Spring PBL was a general IT conference to build awareness on the technology field. 
The purpose of this conference is to target middle school students to take an interest in the field and promote our school. 
Students from Canarelli and Fertita were invited to partake in the conference. My class was in charge of teaching the students 
basic Photoshop editing. The takeaway were printed Photoshop frames that they can hang up in their house for display.

</p>

<p>The conference was fairly successful. Looking back Freshman year I did not know what to expect for the conference 
so this was a huge factor with stress. I pulled through though and it helped me develop my public speaking ability because 
this was the first time I actually speaked in front of a crowd I wasn't familiar with. This conference qualifies for my school's 
professional presentation tenant because I was required to present in front of a large crowd.</p>
