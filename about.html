	<div id="contentAbout">
<p>My name is Tyler Paraiso. I am a Junior that currently attends Southwest Career and Technical Academy.
Ever since I was a child I was interested in crafting things that I can call my own. My creativity had no bounds
and I experimented with a lot of different things. I remember that I used to build terrains for my action figures
using Lego blocks. I lived alongside my coloring book, always trying to find the perfect color scheme
for the picture I was coloring. That passion to create never left me as I matured. Ever since coming to Southwest,
I have learned to further my skills. One day, I hope to become an FBI agent, solving crime and protecting
the ones I hold dear. I aspire to better myself as a person, and hopefully I can reach the goals I have set myself.</p>

<p>My favorite pastime is to listen to music. When I get home the first thing I do is plug my headphone jack
into my computer and open up iTunes so I can listen to my favorite artists. The beauty in music is everlasting,
you can experience a wide array of emotions just through listening to the highs and the lows of the production in
each track.</p>
