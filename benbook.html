<h1 class="portfolioContent">BEN NELSON: LITTLE RED FLYING HOOD
</h1>
<h2>SPRING/SUMMER 2014</h2>

<p>Little Red Flying Hood is a children's book illustrated and written by Ben Nelson. This project was given to my class by my media teacher, Mrs. Clark, and we were tasked to create a marketing campaign for Ben to get his name out there, with the end goal of publishing his book. We were required to create a flash animation about autism or create a website for Benâ€™s book.




</p>

<p>I was in the team that was tasked with creating the website. The website can be viewed here: <a href="http://cartoonben.com">http://cartoonben.com"</a>
