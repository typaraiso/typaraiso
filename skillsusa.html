<h1 class="portfolioContent">SKILLSUSA: STATE 2013</h1>
<h2> SPRING 2013</h2>
<p>The SkillsUSA state conference is the end goal for all SkillsUSA chapters in Nevada. 
In the conference, high schools with SkillsUSA chapters compete in a variety of competitions 
to test their leadership and job skill abilities. Every school wants their chapter to represent 
them at Nationals over summer and everyone works diligently to accomplish that. The competition I 
decided to enter was Quizbowl, a competition that tests my knowledge on general Skills information and more. 
My team and I studied with the hopes of placing first so we can attend Nationals that year.</p>

<p>I remember the adrenaline flowing through my veins after each round in Quizbowl. My hands were 
trembling after each round and the atmosphere was so intimidating. Going into the contest knowing 
that the other schools participated in mock Quizbowl competitions at their home school before being 
sent to State was terrifying. I wasn’t sure if my team and I could even place. When the results were 
posted after each round, showing which teams advanced onto the next round, my team made it to the finals. 
I was ecstatic! Overall, we placed third in the State and it was an amazing feeling to be up on stage 
holding that medal up. This event counts for my school’s content knowledge tenant, because it shows that 
I have the necessary knowledge to place third in Nevada.</p>
