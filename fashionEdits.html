<h2> SUMMER 2013</h2>
<p>	During summer I found myself with nothing to do. Of course, I was swamped with prep work for 
the AP courses I was enrolled for in Junior year but I decided against doing that early. So, throughout summer, 
I ran a fashion blog on Tumblr and I created edits to promote online fashion stores.
</p>

<p>	I used my prior knowledge of Photoshop to create these edits. I knew that filters can change the overall 
appearance of an image so I used those. I did not really know that much about adjustment filters so this was a 
fun exercise to further my knowledge on this. I use adjustment filters now on most of the graphics in web design 
so this was a good skill to learn. This qualifies for my use of resources and work ethic tenants because I took the 
initiative to do something productive with my time during summer and I used the programs available to me.</p>

<p>	These are some examples of the edits I did during summer:</p>
