<h1 class="portfolioContent">OCAMPO ESSAYS</h1>

<h2>WINTER 2013</h2>
<p>	For Sophomore year my teacher, Mr. Ocampo, gave us an essay after we finished reading a novel.
We went through Fahrenheit 451, Outliers, Siddhartha Gautama, and more throughout the year. Each essay 
we had the option to become partnered with someone in our class and I always took that option because I 
thought it would be interesting to see the writing styles of someone else.
</p>

<p>	I would say that every essay helped me progress as a writer. I started the year off with, if I recall correctly, 
a C- on his papers. Afterwards I started to receive better grades essay after essay. Partnering up with someone helped
me with my editing as well. My partner and I would look over each other’s work to see our errors and correct it. It was 
pretty effective considering that I never went to anyone else for advice prior to these assignments. If you would like to 
read the essays I’ve written throughout Sophomore year, here is a link to the file: These assignment qualifies for the writing 
skills tenant because it shows my ability to write.
