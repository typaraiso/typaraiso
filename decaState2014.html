<h1 class="portfolioContent">DECA: STATE 2014</h1>
<h2> WINTER 2014</h2>
<p>The annual DECA state conference brings DECA members throughout the state of Nevada together in order to compete in marketing based competitions. This year I decided to compete in a team based competition, Fashion Merchandising Promotion Plan. My partner, Valerie Ca√±a, and I created a campaign for fashion house Ann Taylor. Along with this, I competed in Retail Merchandising, a solo event.
</p>

<p>For the team based competition, my partner and I created a 10 page marketing plan and presented orally in front of a judge. The results were great! We placed in third overall in the state, meaning that we could advance to nationals! For Retail Merchandising, I was given a scenario and bullet points to hit while I presented in front of two judges. I managed to place second overall. Nationals will certainly be fun!
